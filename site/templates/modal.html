                <h1>No Longer Human</h1>
                <em>Osamu Dazai</em><br>
                <p class="subtext">1948</p><br>
                
                <p>In a semi autobiographical account of real and imagined battles, Dazai writes about his conflicting persona. He describes his outward personality as a costume suitable for a clown, while within his seriousness and inability to be entertained cause catastrohic social anxiety.</p>
                <p>This book is not to be read during a bought of depression. It is not for the light-hearted. It is a most disturbing yet relatable record of mental illness and suffering. The narrater is a reflection of us all, bolded and italisized, with the more somber and terrifying parts highlighted. Simultanelousy, he is so very alone.</p>
                <p>Published in Japan in the late 1940s shortly after Dazai committed suicide, No Longer Human is proof to the Japanese populus that ones apparent composure may have more to do with societal norms than genuine agreeance. I highly recommend this book for its historical significance and grotesque allure.</p>
