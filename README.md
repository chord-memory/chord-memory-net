# chord-memory

This is my personal website soon to be available at [chord-memory.net](https://www.chord-memory.net).

## Setup

Must have `python3` and `make` installed.

## Local

To generate the static html files and run the website locally, run
```
make run
```
and then view the site in the browser at `localhost:8000`.
